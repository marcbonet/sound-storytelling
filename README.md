# Sound, Storytelling & Perception — by Marc Bonet

I’m **Marc Bonet**, a Creative Producer and Sound Director with over a decade of international experience shaping narrative-driven audiovisual projects across sport, culture, and brand communication.

My work explores how **sound creates meaning** — as a social, cultural, and emotional force that often goes unnoticed in our visually dominated world.

## Why Sound Matters

Sound is an area of growing **social, cultural, and environmental importance**, yet it remains largely overlooked in an overwhelmingly visual, screen-based society.  
Beyond its technical dimension, sound is one of the **principal channels through which we experience, interpret, and feel the world**.

It carries **information, emotion, and atmosphere**, shaping our perception of space, time, and human presence.  
When crafted with intention, it doesn’t just accompany a story — it *is* the story.

## My Approach

Creating meaningful experiences requires an understanding of:
- the **social and cognitive ways people perceive sound**,  
- how they attach meaning to voices, environments, and rhythm,  
- and how narratives are **constructed and conveyed through auditory cues**.

In every project, my goal is to **bridge craft and understanding** — balancing technical precision with cultural and emotional insight. Whether in documentary storytelling, branded content, or interactive media, I see sound as a **narrative architecture**: a structure that holds experience together.

## Areas of Exploration

- **Sound as Narrative Form**  
  Investigating how sound structures storytelling — shaping mood, perspective, and emotional rhythm.

- **Cross-Cultural Sound Design**  
  Working across languages and contexts to explore how meaning shifts through tone, accent, and sonic aesthetics.

- **Environmental & Spatial Sound**  
  Reflecting on how environments speak: field recording, ambience, and spatial perception as narrative tools.

- **Human–AI Collaboration in Voice**  
  Curiosity about how synthetic voices might extend — rather than replace — human expression and creative storytelling.

## Ongoing Question

> How can we design with sound not just for clarity or impact, but for **empathy** — as a medium that connects people to each other and to the world around them?
